# MG Customization GUI Auto-Update
The MG Customization GUI currently does not automatically update with the mod, making it very tedious to update in BCB. 
Unfortunatley, to update BCB, we need to manually go in and re-make the changes, save to the package, and THEN publish EVERY place that is currently in use.

A solution to this is that we instead require the model, which will cancel out all of this. We can modify the original model if needed.
